If individuals do not wish to participate in the study, their identifiers will be removed. For subjects that do participate, each subject is assigned a unique identification number. All data and other information sent to the Coordinating Center are identified with this number. Subject names and contact information remain solely on a password-protected drive, where the information will be maintained to protect access from unauthorized individuals.
