41.1*  What is the justification for the inclusion of these subject populations?
The aim of the study is to assess treatment approaches for individuals with T1D. Dr. Lee is a practicing pediatric endocrinologist who is a principal investigator on this study, therefore it is conceivable that some of the patients who participate will be patients of Dr. Lee.
 
41.2*  Describe the additional safeguards that have been included in this study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.
The study does not involve any intervention or treatment plan. All identifying information will be kept hidden and confidential. Patients do not have to participate in the study if they do not wish to. Their refusal to participate will in no way affect the medical care that they receive at the University of Michigan. The research staff, Dr. Lee and Dr. Tan will explain to the patients that participation in the study will not impact the care that is provided to them in both the pediatric and adult diabetes clinic.
